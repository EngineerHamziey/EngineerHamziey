# Hello there!

**this is out of date, it was written about a year or 2 years ago**

I Am A Frontend Web Developer **Looking for a full-time/part-time job** and I Make Responsive Websites with Modern Technologies using:

- [HTML 5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/html) - For writing website markup.

- [CSS 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css) - For styling the webpages.

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - I use SASS to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct. I use .SCSS format as its easier to mentain and has no effect on functionality.

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) - I use JavaScript to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, etc.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - I use GitHub for version control, collaboration and alot more. I use `CMDER` CLI tool for Git version control.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I use VS code as it has all the requirements for building web projects and comes with alot of shortcut keys that makes work faster .

- Arduino - Arduino is a C++ framework that I use for embedded systems programming.
**You can go through my pinned repositories which showcase my current skills.**

## A little about me :sunglasses:

I have been learning front-end web development for about 2 years and about a year ago I started building projects at FrontendMentor. I have built over 7 websites that show my front-end skills.Most of them are available on GitHub.I also ensure to write a very informative `README` for each project.

I currently work part-time at `HAMZATRONICS TECHNOLOGIES` where I teach people Frontend Web Development and Embedded Systems programming using Aduino/C++ here in my country.

- I am currently Learning `REACT.js` :muscle:
